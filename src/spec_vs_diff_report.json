  "summary": "Diff adds opt-in auth/navigation diagnostics, updates auth guard to prevent repeated redirects by tracking navigation and clearing intended-route storage, and adjusts auth UI hook/button and error boundary for more stable auth state and safer error rendering. No clear evidence of missing BuildRequest requirements; no clearly unrequested features beyond auth-flow hardening and diagnostics.",
