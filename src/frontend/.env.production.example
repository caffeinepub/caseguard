# CaseGuard Production Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env.production and customize as needed

# Internet Identity URL (optional)
# If not set, defaults to https://identity.ic0.app (recommended for mainnet)
# Only set this if you're using a custom Internet Identity provider
# VITE_II_URL=https://identity.ic0.app

# Note: The frontend will automatically use the default Internet Identity
# service at https://identity.ic0.app when VITE_II_URL is not configured.
# This is the recommended configuration for mainnet deployments.
